You can also add affiliate links when mentioning specific aspects of the product or any complementary items you used in conjunction with it.",
      "Performance evaluation: Assess the product's performance based on criteria such as effectiveness, longevity, ease of use, and any potential side effects. You can also compare it to similar products you've tried in the past. If you're comparing the product to similar products you've tried in the past, you can include affiliate links to those products as well. This gives readers the option to explore and compare alternatives.",
      "Rating: Provide a rating or score for the product based on your overall experience. You can use a simple scale (e.g., 1-5 stars) or break it down into categories such as packaging, formula, and value for money. You may place an affiliate link close to the rating or score, so if readers are convinced by your evaluation, they can quickly access the product.",
      "Conclusion: Summarize your thoughts on the product, and let your readers know if you'd recommend it or not. You can also mention if the product is suitable for specific skin types, concerns, or preferences.  Repeat the affiliate link here, either as a standalone link or incorporated within a call-to-action (e.g., 'Click here to check out the product for yourself').",
      "Call-to-action (CTA): Encourage readers to share their thoughts on the product, ask questions, or suggest other products for you to review. This can help foster engagement and build a sense of community among your readers.",
      "Disclosure: If the product was provided to you for free or if you have an affiliate relationship with the brand, make sure to disclose this information to maintain transparency and credibility.",
